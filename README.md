Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) &amp; Electronic Laboratory Notebook (ELN)

Title: LabNote - Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) & Electronic Laboratory Notebook (ELN)

I. Overview
LabNote is a web application designed to manage laboratory data, workflows, and electronic lab notebooks. The application will utilize an SQLite database for data storage, Tailwind CSS for the user interface, and a combination of jQuery, JavaScript, and PHP for the backend.

II. Main Features

User Authentication and Authorization
Project Management
Sample Management
Inventory Management
Protocol and Procedure Management
Experiment Logging and Documentation
Data Storage and Analysis
Reporting and Exporting
Collaboration and Sharing
Notifications and Reminders

IV. Implementation Suggestions

A. Backend

Use PHP and SQLite for CRUD operations on database tables (users, projects, samples, inventory, protocols, experiments, etc.)
Implement RESTful API endpoints for the frontend to communicate with the backend
B. Frontend

Use Tailwind CSS for a modern and responsive UI
Utilize jQuery and JavaScript for dynamic content, form validation, and AJAX requests to API endpoints
Implement modular components for code reuse and maintainability
C. Database Design

Normalize database schema to minimize redundancy and improve data integrity
Use foreign key constraints to establish relationships between tables (e.g., projects and samples, protocols and experiments)
D. Security

Use secure password hashing and storage
Implement CSRF protection and input validation to prevent attacks
Apply role-based access control to ensure proper user authorization
E. Performance

Optimize database queries and use indexing to improve performance
Implement pagination and lazy loading for large data sets
Utilize caching mechanisms to reduce server load
F. Scalability and Maintenance

Design the application to be modular and maintainable
Use version control (e.g., Git) for collaboration and code management
Implement a test suite to ensure code quality and prevent regressions
